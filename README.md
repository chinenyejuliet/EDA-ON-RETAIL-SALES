# EDA-ON-RETAIL-SALES

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing marketing and seasonal trends in retail sales by conducting  exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail dataset to uncover meaningful insights related to customer behavior, sales patterns and seasonal trends in retail marketing. 
This analysis was carried out using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, with a strong focus on understanding the structure of the dataset, cleaning the data and extracting insights through descriptive statistics and visual exploration.

The purpose of this analysis, as stated in the notebook, is to explore detailed insights into marketing with seasonal trends in retail sales, thereby supporting informed business and marketing decisions.

## Objective 
The specific objectives of this EDA project are to:
1. Explore the structure and contents of the retail dataset
2. Perform necessary data cleaning (handling missing values and duplicates)
3. Extract time-based features such as month and week of the year
4. Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior
5. Examine sales patterns that reveal seasonal and marketing insights.
6. Provide data-driven findings that can support retail strategy

## Data Sources
The primary data used for this analysis is the "retail_data.csv"  containing details of a retail environment with a million rows and 100+ columns, covering customer information, transactional data, product details, promotional information and customer behavior metrics. The dataset is taken from kaggle - feel free to explore them here. [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkalk/large-retail-data-set-for-eda)

## Methodology

The EDA followed a structured process exactly as implemented in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Tools and Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were imported and used:
- Pandas – for data loading, manipulation and analysis
- NumPy – for numerical operations
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – for data visualization

## Data Analysis and Results

### Customer Analysis

- Customer distribution was analyzed by gender, showing variation in customer participation across gender groups.
- Customer counts were also examined based on marital status, providing insights into demographic composition.


### Time-Based and Seasonal Insights

- Transactions were analyzed by month of the year and week of the year.
- These variables enabled identification of seasonal sales patterns relevant to retail marketing strategies.

### Transaction and Customer Frequency

- The number of unique customers was calculated to understand customer reach.
- Transaction frequency patterns provided insight into repeat purchases and customer engagement.

### Transaction and Customer Frequency

## Recommendation

- Leverage Seasonal Trends to develop targeted marketing campaigns during peak periods and promotional offers during low-activity periods to stabilize sales.
- Insights from customer demographics such as gender and marital status should be used to develop personalized marketing strategies that better address the preferences of dominant customer groups.
- Loyalty programs and customer engagement initiatives can help increase customer retention and lifetime value.
